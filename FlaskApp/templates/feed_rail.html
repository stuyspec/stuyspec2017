                Im Blessed says exactly where I am in my life, blessed to still be making music that people want to hear,” says Wilson. "2016 was a tough year for so many people around the world, so Im proud to release a song to remind us that we can all find some blessings in our lives. And having T.I. bring his flavor, sharing who he is and how his journey is filled with blessings, is an added bonus."
